"<p><h1>File Associations</h1> This module allows you to choose which "
"applications are associated with a given type of file. File types are also "
"referred to as MIME types (MIME is an acronym which stands for "
"\"Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions\").</p><p> A file association "
"consists of the following: <ul><li>Rules for determining the MIME-type of a "
"file, for example the filename pattern *.png, which means 'all files with "
"names that end in .png', is associated with the MIME type \"image/png\";</"
"li> <li>A short description of the MIME-type, for example the description of "
"the MIME type \"image/png\" is simply 'PNG image';</li> <li>An icon to be "
"used for displaying files of the given MIME-type, so that you can easily "
"identify the type of file in a file manager or file-selection dialog (at "
"least for the types you use often);</li> <li>A list of the applications "
"which can be used to open files of the given MIME-type -- if more than one "
"application can be used then the list is ordered by priority.</li></ul> You "
"may be surprised to find that some MIME types have no associated filename "
"patterns; in these cases, KDE is able to determine the MIME-type by directly "
"examining the contents of the file.</p>"
