"A prefix for identifiers of map browser widgets. Based on that, identifiers "
"such as mapBrowser1, mapBrowser2 are generated. This string can be used to "
"refer the widget object as variables in programming languages or macros so "
"it must _not_ contain white spaces and non latin1 characters, should start "
"with lower case letter and if there are subsequent words, these should start "
"with upper case letter. Example: smallCamelCase. Moreover, try to make this "
"prefix as short as possible."
