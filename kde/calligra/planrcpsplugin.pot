"<title>RCPS Scheduler</title><para>The Resource Constrained Project "
"Scheduler (RCPS) focuses on scheduling the project to avoid overbooking "
"resources. It still respects task dependencies and also tries to fullfill "
"time constraints. However, time constraints can make it very difficult to "
"find a good solution, so it may be preferable to use a different scheduler "
"in these cases.</para>"
