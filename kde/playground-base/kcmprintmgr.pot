"<h1>Printers</h1>The KDE printing manager is part of KDEPrint which is the "
"interface to the real print subsystem of your Operating System (OS). "
"Although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those "
"subsystems, KDEPrint depends on them for its functionality. Spooling and "
"filtering tasks, especially, are still done by your print subsystem, or the "
"administrative tasks (adding or modifying printers, setting access rights, "
"etc.)<br/> What print features KDEPrint supports is therefore heavily "
"dependent on your chosen print subsystem. For the best support in modern "
"printing, the KDE Printing Team recommends a CUPS based printing system."
